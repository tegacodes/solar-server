  <h3>Call for Server Stewards</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a work in progress, if you are interested in getting
    involved please reach out to us or join our <a href="https://tinyletter.com/Solar-Protocol">project newsletter for
    occasional updates.</a>  If you are interested in stewarding a server as part of
    Solar Protocol, please keep reading.
  </p>
  <p>
    A server steward is someone who can host and care for a solar server and who
    is interested in being a guest collaborator on our project.*
  </p>

  <p>
    We're currently looking for people or organizations in different locations
    around the world who would like to steward one of our servers for at least a
    year and who are also interested in contributing their domain expertise to
    help us explore this type of network together. We are aiming to establish a
    server on every continent in the world (except perhaps for Antarctica).
  </p>

  <p>
    Ideally, a server steward would have a basic understanding of programming
    (specifically with Raspberry Pi/ Linux) and IT infrastructure to assist us
    with troubleshooting the installation. However, we are also able to bring on
    a few collaborators with less experience and who can offer different
    perspectives on the project. At this point there is opportunity for both
    institutional collaborators like arts venues and universities that might be
    able fund their own participation as well as individuals or collectives
    without these resources. If you fall into the latter group, we have a budget
    to cover expenses for DIY/independent collaborators. Server stewards should
    demonstrate a willingness to build community and share materials and
    resources through teaching and learning.
  </p>

    If you have a sunny rooftop and are interested in experimenting with us,
    please read the questions and answers below and fill out this brief

  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <h5>
    What are the technical and physical requirements for a hosting a server ?
  </h5>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You need a safe and accessible outdoor area that is exposed to direct
      sunlight for at least 4 hours per day (this means a spot that is free from
      obstructions/shadows and ideally facing the equator)
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to be able to secure the solar panel to a wall, pole or rooftop
      so it doesn't blow away or get stolen
    </li>
    <li>
      The server needs Internet access either via ethernet cable or wifi
      (minimum network speed: 25mb/s up & 25mb/s down)
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to be able to set up port forwarding for both http (port 80) and
      ssh (port 20) with your Internet Service Provider to serve the solar
      protocol network publically
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>What is the timing of this project?</h5>

  <p>
    We are looking to set up servers with stewards in the first 3 months of
    2021. We ask you to steward and care for your server for a minimum of 12
    months.
  </p>
  <h5>Do I need to speak English?</h5>

  <p>
    Unfortunately our team only speaks English and Italian. We’d be happy to try
    to find a translator and we would also be interested in translating the
    project into the language spoken by server stewards.
