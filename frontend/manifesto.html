    <h3>Towards a Natural Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      The Solar Protocol network reconfigures internet protocols using a 
      kind of <i>natural</i> rather than <i>artificial</i> intelligence. 
      The network routes internet traffic according to the logic of the sun, 
      where page requests are sent to whichever server is enjoying the most 
      sunlight at the time. We are working with people around the world who have 
      built and installed servers that host this site alongside their own web content. 
      When their server becomes the active node of the network, their online 
      materials (if any) will soon become visible on this site.
    </p>
    <p>
      If intelligence is the capacity to synthesize knowledge as logic and 
      apply that logic to make decisions, then the Solar Protocol platform relies 
      on an intelligence that emerges from earthly dynamics: specifically that of 
      the sun’s interaction with the Earth. Our lives have always been directed by a 
      range of natural logics that emerge from the intermittent dynamics of our 
      shared environment. Weather, seasons, tides and atmospheric conditions 
      all dictate our behavior, enabling and constraining our movements, 
      food production and cultures. Solar Protocol uses these logics to automate 
      decisions about how the network operates and what content is shown at different 
      times of the day. How can we learn or relearn to design with natural intelligence?
    </p>

    <p>
      The present day imagination for the internet has been enabled by an 
      energy regime that relies on lethal fossil fuels. And the result? An online 
      culture that valorizes speed, self expression through ever larger media and 
      data-driven intelligence that is requiring more and more energy. Machine learning 
      for example, requires enormous datasets typically collected through private 
      efforts in online digital surveillance that collect every click, keypress, view 
      and page scroll you might make. This data is then used to train models used to 
      automate decisions about what content to show you. These energy hungry 
      technologies are only made possible by extractive energy systems and labor practices. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In response and by working within natural 
      limitations, we have deliberately chosen not to use large assets nor 
      energy-intensive tracking technologies on this website.<sup>1</sup> A solar-powered web could reduce the opportunity for these kinds of 
      surveillance and data-driven practices and the business models that go with them, 
      something that is likely to have desirable political effects. As Timothy Mitchel 
      points out in Carbon Democracy, different energy regimes create different political 
      possibilities.<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <h4>Energy-centered Design</h4>
    <p>Solar-powered technologies catalyze a need for energy-centered design where the 
      energetic dimension of cultural production is centered. On a solar-powered server, 
      it is advantageous to minimize the amount of data being transmitted and it is 
      therefore desirable to reduce the size of the media published. The intermittency 
      of solar energy production also produces environmentally programmed downtime, 
      where one’s server might sleep at night, or for the long evenings in the winter, 
      demanding that you stop working and focus your attention elsewhere. </p>
      <p>Energy-centered design is also about accountability. In building this website, 
        we have attempted to do the computation work required to generate the visualizations on the server-side, rather than by using Javascript in the client’s 
        browser.  In other words, our servers do the heavy lifting as opposed to your computer. In this way, we are assured that these computational cycles are 
        powered by solar rather than fossil fuels. This inverts a capitalist logic that incentivizes us to 
    export costs to someone else somewhere else, a drive that has produced concurrent ecological crises.<sup>3</sup> Instead, we call for new forms of cultural production that embody a politics of accountability. </p>
      <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p>1. This approach was used by the <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Solar Powered
    Website</a> published by Low Tech Magazine (2019) and we have taken much
    inspiration from this groundbreaking project.  </p>
    2. See Timothy Mitchell’s book, Carbon democracy: Political power in
      the age of oil (2011), that discusses the political consequences of
      different energy systems. </p>

      3. Joana Moll's <a href="https://www.janavirgin.com/AMZ/"><i>Hidden Life of an Amazon User</i></a> demonstrates this through the 
      case study of buying Jeff Bezos' book from the Amazon website. In this project she 
      audits the eyewatering amount of computational work and energy expenditure that is outsourced to a 
      user's computer by the Amazon website (presumably in order to track 
      their behaviors and show them 'relevant' ads).
