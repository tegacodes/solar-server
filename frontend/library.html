                <h2>Solar Powered Media</h2>
                <h4>A Resource for Energy Responsive Web Design</h4>
                <p>The Solar Powered Media project explores energy responsive design. We are a team of designers,
                    researchers and artists experimenting with ways of designing, building and hosting low energy
                    websites with off-grid solar powered systems. We are concerned with critiquing the ‘seamless’ user
                    experiences touted by many popular online platforms and we seek to expand the narrow discourse of
                    ‘user’ or human centered design to include the ecological context of the user. After all, media
                    technologies are geological. They are not only literally made of rocks, but are also agents in the
                    composition of the atmosphere.</p>

                <h4>Energy Responsive Design</h4>
                <p>This website is solar powered. It runs from a very small single-board computer powered by an
                    off-grid solar energy system. It publically visualizes information about its energy production,
                    showing the energy it consumes, its battery levels and the environmental conditions at the server.
                </p>

                <p>The design of this website is also energy responsive: the characteristics of the servers energy
                    system inform the experience design and appearance of the site. The layout and the resolution of the
                    assets change depending on the solar energy available. A higher resolution site is presented when
                    the sun is shining, or when the battery is full, and the design of the site changes if less energy
                    is available. A raw text version of the site is served when the battery is low, and it may go
                    offline from time to time.</p>

                <p>Inspiration and precedents for this project include Low-tech Magazine’s solar-powered website, that
                    drastically reduces the energy required for users to access the magazine content, artists like Joana
                    Moll who explore the energy footprint of the Internet and Alex Nathanson’s solar power art archive.
