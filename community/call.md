# Call: Round 1 host sites

This is a small privat-ish call to our community to find hosts with some technical know-how who can help us debug, test the technical aspects of the network and ideate conceptual experiments to test on it. Sort of like an expanded working group to test the project. 

# Call: Round 2 host sites

This could be to find a second round of hosts who can be less tech savy. This round could be more about education and cultivating interest in communities who we don't know?

# Call: Solar Protocol Library ?

This is a content call for the distributed library. Prior projects that give us a model for how this might work are Additivism and Cybernetics Library. This call is to amass content, projects, resources and current thinking on how to desgin technology in dialogue with natural lofics and within planetary boundaries. 


We call for projects that explore: 
* minimal computing
* natural logics
* delights of intermittent technology
* minimal low data VR
* sun-responsive computing
