# Site Assessment

If selected, we will be working closely with each site to support installations and tailor instructions as needed.

## What physical infrastructure is needed to host a Solar Protocol server?

Successfully installing a Solar Protocol server requires a safe and accessible location that is available for at least 1 year and has adequate sunlight and internet access.

### Installation requirements
<p>
We will deliver the materials in the most plug and play way possible. However, there will still be some level of installation requirements and minimal wiring. There will also be some additional software configuration required.
</p>
<p>
The hardware consists of a solar module and module mount, which you will need to install either on a wall, pole, or on the ground; an enclosure with the electronic components, which will sit on the ground; and a battery, which you will need to plug in to the enclosure.
</p>
<p>
Tools required for installation:

* wrench
* pliers
* screw driver
* drill for wall mounting (or hammer drill if wall is brick/concrete/stone/etc)

## Solar Insolation

Assessing how much sunlight your solar module will receive is crucial to the success of the project. This primarily involves identifying obstructions that may block sunlight during the hours of 9am-3pm.

* What is your site's longitude and latitude?
* What are the potential obstructions? 
	* The area needs to be clear of objects that may cast a shadow on the module from the direction of the equator and to the left and right at least 45 degrees in both direction.
* Please provide 3 photos from the proposed locations
	* directly facing the equator (south facing in the northern hemisphere, north facing in the southern hemisphere)
	* 45 degrees east
	* 45 degrees west
* What is the best way to mount the module in this location?
	* Ground mounted: Is the surface flat and does it have proper drainage?
	* Wall mounted: Is there a wall facing the proper direction that you can screw in to?
	* Pole mounted: Is there a pole that you can strap the solar module to?

## Physical Access

* Please describe the physical location. How is the space generally used and who has access to it?
* Will you be able to safely install the equipment in the location? This entails:
	* bringing equipment to site (the equipment is heavy and will be difficult for 1 person if a ladder is required)
	* assembling and installing mount (requires wrench and/or pliers, and if wall mounted a drill or hammer drill)
	* connect battery to charge controller (requires wrench and/or pliers)
* Will the equipment be safe from tampering for the duration of the project?
* Can you run an ethernet cable to the location?

## Internet Connectivity

* Does your site have wifi?
* Does your site have an accessible ethernet port or can an ethernet cable be run from the site to an active ethernet port?
* Are you able to establish a publically accessible IP address?
	* is it a static or dynamic public IP?
* Are you able to establish a static IP on your LAN?
* Are you able to set up port forwarding for both http (port 80) and ssh (port 20)?
* What is your network speed?
	* Minimum network speed: 25mb/s up & 25mb/s down
