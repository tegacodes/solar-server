# Community Agreement and Collaborator Responsibilities

An living document outlining the values and collaborative structure of the Solar Protocol project and community.

## Guiding Questions

* Are there changes we want to make to the way we have been working as we enter a new phase of the project?
* How do we set expectations for each other, servers hosts, content developers, and users?
* How do we work together?
* How do we collaborate and is that different from working together?
* How do we express when we don't have availability to work on this project?
* How do we track project progress?
* What does making space for self-care look like in the context of solar-protocol?
* How is labor divided?
* What are some guiding principles for content related to issues like safer-spaces, inclusivity, etc.?

## Project Background

Funding for Solar Protocol has been provided by Eye Beam.

## Project Organizers/ Leads

Tega Brain, Alex Nathanson, Benedetta Piantella

### Responsibilities

Design and test hardware and backbone of the networked system.

## Server Hosts

Hardware hosts will provide an outdoor physical location to host the server for at least 1 year. They will receive $1000 USD in total for hosting the server. They will receive $500 at the beginning and $500 after 12 months.

### Responsibilities

* Attend 1 hr workshop with Project Organizers about setting up the system.
* Be available for troubleshooting as needed throughout the year.
* Host the server for at least 1 year. If you need to end your involvement for any reason prior to 1 year, you will be required to return the hardware. You will be able to keep the initial $500, but will not receive the final payment. After 1 year, the hardware will become yours. You are encouraged to keep it running on our network, but you can also repurpose it for whatever you want.

## Content Developers

### Responsibilities

Specific responsibilities will vary based on the content being developed.
