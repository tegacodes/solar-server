   <h4>Glossary</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Photovoltaic (PV): A PV panel refers to a solar panel, and a PV system may consist of the panel and a number of other electrical components, often referred to as BOS components.</li>
      <li>Balance of system (BOS) components: Supporting hardware for a PV system, apart from the panel itself. This can include wiring, switches, support racks, inverters, and other components.</li>
      <li>Life-cycle analysis (LCA): An assessment of the cumulative environmental impacts of a product, from the beginning of its production all the way to the end of its use.</li>
      <li>Embedded/Embodied Energy: The total energy expended in the manufacturing of a product.</li>
      <li>Energy Payback Time (EPBT): The time taken for an energy source to recoup its embedded energy. After EPBT, the energy gain of the product is net positive.</li>
      <li>Energy return on investment (EROI): The ratio of the total energy gain over an energy sourceâ€™s full life cycle to its embodied energy.</li>
      <li>Grid-tied vs. off-grid: A grid-tied PV system works in tandem with the electricity grid, often involving a deal in which the utility company buys excess power from the user. An off-grid PV system is self-contained, consisting of only the solar hardware and the load that it is powering.</li>
      <li>Crystalline silicon technology: Monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) panels are made by slicing whole bars of silicon into wafers, while polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) panels are made by melting together multiple crystals of silicon to form wafers. Mono-Si panels offer higher efficiency (allowing for smaller form factor), but with higher upfront cost and longer EPBT. Poly-Si panels are less efficient but also cost less up front and pay back sooner.</li>
    </ul>
