<h2>About</h2>
  <h4>Solar Powered Media: A Resource for Energy Centered Web Design</h4>
  <p class = "indexcopy">The Solar Powered Media project explores energy centered design and solar powered computation. 
    We are a team of designers, researchers and artists experimenting with ways of designing, building and hosting low 
    energy websites with off-grid solar powered systems. We are concerned with critiquing the ‘seamless’ user experiences 
    touted by many popular online platforms and we seek to expand the narrow discourse of ‘user’ or human centered 
    design to include the ecological context of the user. After all, media technologies are geological. They are not only literally 
    made of rocks, but are also agents in the composition of the atmosphere.

  <h4>Energy Centered Design</h4>
  <p>This website is solar powered. It runs from a very small single-board computer powered by an off-grid solar energy system. 
    It publically visualizes information about its energy production, showing the energy it consumes, its battery levels and the 
    environmental conditions at the server. 
  </p>

  <p>The design of this website is also energy responsive: the status of the server’s energy system shapes the experience design 
    and appearance of the site. The layout and the resolution of the assets change depending on the solar energy available. A 
    higher resolution site is presented when the sun is shining, or when the battery is full, and the design of the site changes if 
    less energy is available. A raw text version of the site is served when the battery is low, and it may go offline from time to time.</p>

    <p>Inspiration and precedents for this project include Low-tech Magazine’s <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">solar-powered website</a>, that drastically reduces the 
      energy required for users to access the magazine content, artist <a href="http://www.janavirgin.com/">Joana Moll's work</a> exploring the energy footprint of the Internet 
      and <a href="https://alexnathanson.com/">Alex Nathanson’s</a> solar power art archive.
